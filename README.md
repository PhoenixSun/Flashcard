# Flashcard

Flashcard is an Android app that allows students to make flashcards in a collaborative manner. Users can make real-time changes to their data, such as creating flashcard folders for different classes, adding and removing flashcards, editing the content of a flashcard. It also provides two ways to view the flashcards – Browse Mode and Review Mode – so that the user can study in the way they prefer.
